//! <p>Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB provides developers the freedom to focus on application development. <p> A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler, requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach eliminates the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and performance tuning. Developers gain access to this functionality within Amazon&#39;s proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and pay only for what they use. </p> <p> Visit <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/">http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/</a> for more information. </p></p>

//! If you're using the service, you're probably looking for [SimpleDbClient](struct.SimpleDbClient.html) and [SimpleDb](trait.SimpleDb.html).
